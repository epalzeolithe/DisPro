# GoDispatchProxy
Made by SirSAC for Network.

## Rationale
The idea for this project came from [go-dispatch-proxy](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/go-dispatch-proxy) which is written in Go.
I needed something advanced, portable, stable & light, preferably a single binary without polluting the entire drive and without random issues.

## Credits
